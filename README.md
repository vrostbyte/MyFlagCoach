MyFlagCoach - Project PhoenixThis is the codebase for the Project Phoenix rebuild of the MyFlagCoach web application. This version is built using React to create a more powerful, reliable, and visually appealing coaching tool.ðŸš€ How to RunSince this is a modern React application, you cannot simply open the index.html file in your browser. You will need a simple local web server. The easiest way to do this is with the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.Install Live Server:Open Visual Studio Code.Go to the Extensions view (the icon with four squares on the side panel).Search for "Live Server" by Ritwick Dey.Click "Install".Start the Server:With your project folder open in VS Code, right-click on the index.html file in the file explorer.Select "Open with Live Server".Your default web browser will open with the application running.ðŸ“‚ Project StructureThe project is organized into a few key files:index.html: The main entry point for the application. It loads React, Tailwind CSS, and our application code.app.jsx: The heart of the application. This single file contains all the React components that make up the user interface and the core logic.playbook.js: The "brain" of the app. This file contains all the data for your formations, routes, and concepts in a new, easy-to-edit format.README.md: This file.ðŸ§  How to Edit the PlaybookAll of your team's specific plays are located in playbook.js. To add a new route or concept, simply follow the existing data structure. The application will automatically read the data and create the necessary buttons and drawings.
