MyFlagCoach - Project PhoenixWelcome to the repository for MyFlagCoach, a dynamic, web-based play-calling application for flag football coaches, rebuilt from the ground up with a modern tech stack.This "Project Phoenix" version represents a significant architectural upgrade from the original vanilla JavaScript prototype. It leverages the power of React to create a faster, more reliable, and more visually impressive tool that is truly ready for the sideline.Key Features & ArchitectureReact-Powered: The entire application is a single, powerful React component. This makes managing the complex state of play calls effortless and eliminates entire categories of bugs.Modern Tooling, Zero Build Step: The app uses modern libraries like React, Tailwind CSS, and Babel, but they are all loaded directly in the browser via script tags. This means no complex setup is required. You can run this project just by opening the index.html file.Data-Driven UI: The user interface is generated dynamically from the playbook.js file. This "Playbook Brain" contains all the data for formations, routes, and concepts. To add a new play, you simply edit the data, and the UI will update automatically.Accurate Visuals: The field and routes are rendered as SVG elements, providing a clean, scalable, and accurate representation of your plays. This version features a more intuitive vertical field, precise player alignments, and color-coded routes for key players.Project Structure/MyFlagCoach

How to Run the ApplicationThis project is designed to be as simple as possible to get up and running.Recommended Method: Live Server (VS Code)Install the Extension: If you don't have it already, install the Live Server extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace.Open the Project: Open the MyFlagCoach folder in VS Code.Go Live: Right-click on the index.html file in the VS Code explorer and select "Open with Live Server".Your default web browser will open, and the application will be running. The live server will also automatically reload the page whenever you save changes to a file, which is perfect for development.Alternative Method: Direct File OpeningYou can also simply find the index.html file in your file explorer and double-click it. However, this method may not work reliably in all browsers due to security policies around loading local files (file:///...). The Live Server method is strongly recommended.This project is a living document of your team's offense. As you continue to refine your playbook, this tool will evolve with you.
